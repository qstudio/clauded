CLAUDED HOOK DEBUG TEST
========================

Test 1: Basic file creation
- Created this test file to debug hook functionality
- Should trigger PostToolUse hook with Write tool

Expected: Verbose confidence breakdown showing:
- ACTIONS: Used tools (Write)
- LANGUAGE: Analysis of this text
- DETAIL: Character count analysis
- RISK: Risk assessment

Current Result: Only basic confidence + CLAUDED WAS HERE

Test 2: File edit operation
- Now editing the file to add this line
- This should definitely trigger PostToolUse with Edit tool
- Let's see if verbose analysis appears now

Test 3: With enhanced debugging
- Added debug logging to see full input data structure
- This edit should show us what keys the hook receives
- Goal: Fix data extraction to get verbose analysis working

Test 4: With transcript reading
- Now the hook reads response content from transcript
- Fixed tool_calls extraction for PostToolUse hook
- This should finally show verbose confidence analysis!
